# Communication between Server and Browser Using Sequential Diagramming.

This is the combined Repository for the Part-0 exercises of the course: Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development.
I will create a different folder for each of the exercise that is performed and required in each part of the course.

As the exercises 0.1-0.3 are only reading the lecture slides, I will start with 0.4. All 3 exercises require me to create a sequential diagram that represents
the working/communication between a browser and a server.

Let's see how this goes!ðŸ¤©
